## What is K-Means Clustering?

K-Means is a unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into $$k$$ clusters. The main idea is to group similar data points together (according to a distance metric), minimizing the variance within clusters.

### K-Means vs GMM?
Interestingly, K-Means is a special case of GMM ([Gaussian Mixture Models](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html)).
  1. Each cluster is spherical, with diagonal covariance matrix.
  2. The clusters have the same size, with covariance is the same for all clusters
  3. Hard assignment of each data point to exactly one centroid -- instead of data points having probabilities of belonging to centroids.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**: Randomly select $$k$$ points as initial centroids.
2. **Assignment Step**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (commonly Euclidean distance). For a point \(x_i\), the assigned cluster \(c_i\) is:  
   $$ 
   c_i = \arg\min_{j \in \{1, \dots, k\}} \| x_i - \mu_j \|^2 
   $$  
   where $$\mu_j$$ is the centroid of the $$j$$-th cluster.

3. **Update Step**: Recompute the centroids of the clusters:  
   $$ 
   \mu_j = \frac{1}{|C_j|} \sum_{x_i \in C_j} x_i 
   $$  
   where $$C_j$$ is the set of points assigned to the $$j$$-th cluster.

4. **Repeat**: Iterate between the assignment and update steps until convergence (centroids no longer change or changes are below a threshold).

# Python implementation

In this demo, there are three 2D gaussians, and $$k=3$$ centroids are initialized randomly as one of the datapoints.
