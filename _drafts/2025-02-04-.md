So this model [DeepSeek-R1](https://chat.deepseek.com/) has nice DeepThink feature which have the model monologue in the `<think></think>` tag.

Model is open-sourced, e.g. [DeepSeek R1 on Github](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1)

Here are my thoughts.

# 1. Cool logo.

<figcaption>Whale is cute.</figcaption>
</html>

AI models should have cute animal branding like llama, cats, whales.

# 2. Long think: 7 minutes of thinking with _simple_ question

Give it a **hard** ML research problem, like approximating ReLU with only addition and multiplication.

I managed to let this run for like 7 minutes. And answer is worse than ChatGPT.

# 3. Alignment

For anything geopolitical and genocide. The model print out things and hide, maybe not DeepSeek-R1 itself but the online chat service by DeepSeek has filter.

For religion, I tested for Islam -- this model is aligned to respect muslims.

Tried to ask it to print out pages of verses of [surah al-Baqarah](https://quran.com/ms/al-baqarah), it declined and declined.

Despite being AI, it has much more decency than human beings who corrupted text and claimed the text is word of God.

# Conclusion

There are other nice things like Search feature, sadly it is with online seems not available on locally downloaded DeepSeek-R1
The tides have turned.
